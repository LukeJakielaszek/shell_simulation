main.c:
  parameters: none
  output: current directory printed to command line
  Implementation:
    initializes environment variables. Creates a while true loop which
    prints out the current directory to screen, reads user input,
    prints user input to screen, then parses input by whitespace,
    searching for commands. There will be a switch statement that
    calls shell functions based upon user input.

  Implementation:
    flag that determines whether wait is called in main when execvp is called.
    
program invocations:
  parameters: argv
  output: dependant on the program called
  Implementation:
    parent process is forked, set up argv by passed in params, add null to final
    element of argv. Execvp is called, passing in path to file and argv
